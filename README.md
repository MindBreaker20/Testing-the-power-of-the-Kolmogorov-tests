Using appropriate simulations, examine the power of the Kolmogorov test and the Kolmogorov test with the use of PIT (probability integral transform), with the main hypothesis that the feature has a normal distribution when the data comes from the Student's ùë° distribution or from the chi-square distribution. In order for the results to be comparable, it is necessary to standardize the data. The obtained results should be presented on appropriate graphs illustrating the test power, taking into account:
- the number of data,
- the number of degrees of freedom of the generated Student t-distribution, chi-square
